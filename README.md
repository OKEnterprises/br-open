# br-open
a ZSH script to open a local file with Brave Browser on macOs

This is a one-line wrapper function, and an extremely simple one at that. 
The script appends '.html' to the filename provided, then opens that file in Brave Browser.

Usage: 
```
./br-open [file-name]
./br-open index
./br-open 1234091
```
